# Twitter-EDA-Trump-
Simple EDA of Donald Trump's tweets using pandas and plotly (beginner project).

This was a project to get me started with pandas and working with text data. I also used this as an opportunity to learn some plotly. 
I originally did this project with a dataset from Kaggle from a fixed timepoint. However for completeness, I created a Twitter scraping script here to scrape an up-to-date dataset. 

We examine the following areas: 

* Favorites and retweets - What are the trends over time, and what is the most favorited/retweeted? 
* Hashtags and mentions - What are the most common hashtags and who is mentioned most frequently? 
* Content and length - What common words and phrases are used? (WordCloud) Does length influence popularity of the tweet? 
* Tweeting habits - What days does he tweet most frequently? How have his tweeting habits changed overtime?
